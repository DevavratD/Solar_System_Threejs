## Description

This project is a simple representation of the solar system created using Three.js. The GIF above showcases the basic functionality of the project, where you can see the planets rotating around the sun in a 3D space.

## How It Was Made

I created this project to learn about Three.js and explore 3D rendering in web applications. The planets are represented as spheres with textures, and the scene includes a sun that rotates. The project utilizes basic lighting and orbital controls to enhance the user experience.

## Features
- 3D representation of the solar system.
- Interactive camera controls using OrbitControls.
- Basic lighting with directional and ambient light.
- Textured planets and a sun for a realistic look.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevavratD/Solar_System_Threejs.git
